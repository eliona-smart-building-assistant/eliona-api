name: operationMode
description: |
  The operation mode is specifically designed for conducting bulk operations and plays a crucial role in determining
  the treatment of the list of resources.
  - 'normal' (default mode): In this mode, the method is executed as intended. GET operation returns resources,
  PUT operation creates or updates resources, POST operation updates resources, and DELETE operation deletes the
  specified resources.
  - 'verify': When using this mode, the response provides valuable information about the anticipated outcomes
  of the resources when performing the 'normal' mode. It includes a detailed list of results, such as "would be
  updated" and "cannot be deleted," offering valuable insights into the potential consequences before actually
  executing the operation. The response is handled with the 303 (see other) status code.
